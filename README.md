# TIC - TAC - TOE

## Description

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made in ruby.

## Instructions

To play the game, you need to have ruby installed in your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

After installing ruby, you can clone this repository by typing the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:franclobo/tic-tac-toe.git
```

Then, you need to navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and type the following command:

```
ruby bin/main.rb
```

After that, you can start playing the game.

## How to play

The game is played by two players. The first player will be assigned the symbol 'X' and the second player will be assigned the symbol 'O'.

The game will ask you to enter the name of the first player and the name of the second player. After that, the game will ask you to enter the position where you want to place your symbol. The positions are numbered from 1 to 9, starting from the top left corner and ending in the bottom right corner.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
